# DS-Project
Code for web scrapping project for the course- Intro to Data Science.


This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks:
  -idc409_project_bio.ipynb – Data scraping and analysis for biology faculty website.
  -idc409_projectformech.ipynb – Data scraping and analysis for mechanical engineering faculty website.

Additionally, the repository includes two SQLite databases:
  -faculty_detail_biology.db
  -faculty_engg_inf.db

Each notebook follows this general pattern:
  -Web Scraping – Fetch data from departmental web pages.
  -Data Cleaning – Parse HTML, extract details (e.g. name, department, email), clean and structure.
  -Storage – Save cleaned data into .db SQLite databases.
  -EDA – Storage in Pandas data frame for visualizations and statitical analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  -Insights – Summarize findings about research areas, positions held, awards, education etc.
